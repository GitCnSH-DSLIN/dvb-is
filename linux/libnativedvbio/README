libNativeDVBIO
==============

This is the video for linux (V4L) implementation of the native library used
by JAVA DVB Input Stream API at: http://czentral.org/dvb/io/

To compile you need the V4L and JNI headers available on standard include
paths. Additional paths can be defined using CFLAGS environment variables.
About the usage of CFLAGS please check out your gcc documentation.

INSTALL
=======

Before running ./configure, you have to ensure the correct PREFIX used by your
system. This is the default directory for 3rd party (non-system) programs and
it is dependant on your DISTRIBUTION. FreeBDS uses /usr/local which is the
default. Debian (and many other linux distros) on the other hand use /usr
directory.

So if you are installing this package on Debian/GNU Linux you have to run:
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr

If configuration failed due to missing jni headers, you have to find them and
add the directory to CFLAGS. Note that CFLAGS could already have a value so
it's a good idea to append any old values after ours. A quick example
for OpenJDK:
$ export CFLAGS="-I/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/include $CFLAGS"
